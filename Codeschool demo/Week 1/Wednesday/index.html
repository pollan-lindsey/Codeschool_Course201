    !-- Let's create an HTML document! -->

    <!-- THE BEGINNING -->

    <!-- We need to tell our browser what type of document we are using -->
    <!DOCTYPE html>

    <!-- I need a certain tag that represents the container for my HTML elements  -->
    <html>

    <!-- I need somewhere to put my metadata (data about HTML) what do I need here? -->
    <head>
        <title>
        My Cool Website
        </title>
        <link rel='stylesheet' href='style.css' />
    </head>
    <!-- TRUE or FALSE: The end user (browser view) can see ALL the code above? -->
    <!--   the above statement is FALSE  -->
    --------------------------------

    <!-- MAIN CONTENT -->

    <!-- We need yet another container to wrap our HTML code displayed to the user. -->
    <body>

    <!-- We are going to add several HTML pages. We need a section to navigate to them quickly-->
        <header>
        <a href='aboutme.html'>About Me</a>
        </header>

    <!-- Lets make 3 other containers for each of our sections. How should we do this? -->
        <!-- We should style our containers depending on what section they are in. We should give them names.. -->
        <!-- We need text to show in each container.. How should we do this? -->
        <div class-"container-one">
        <p>
            Welcome to my page!
            <strong>Here are 3 things you can learn from me:</strong>
            <!-- We should probably add some numbered points here! -->
            <ol>
                <li>
                    I have great hair
                </li>
                <li>
                    I have great glasses
                </li>
                <li>
                    I have a dog
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p> 
        
        </div>
        <!-- We need some text to be bold, and some text to be italic. Any ideas?  -->
        <div class="container-two">
        <p> <i> I love to code bcause....</i> </p>
        
    <!--   We probably need to add some bullet points here, because the information does not need to be in order.. -->
            <ul>
                <li>
                    It's fun
                </li>
                <li>
                    It's interesting
                </li>
                <li>
                    it's challenging
                </li>
                
            </ul>
